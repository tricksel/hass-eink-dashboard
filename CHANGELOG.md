## [Unreleased]

### Added

- SVG rendering pipeline: all widgets are now rendered as Jinja2 SVG templates
  rasterised by `resvg-py`, replacing the PIL drawing infrastructure.
- WebSocket commands `eink_dashboard/render_widget` and
  `eink_dashboard/render_widgets` for fetching server-rendered SVG previews
  from the Lovelace editor.
- Shared SVG macro library (`_macros.svg.j2`) for card borders, dividers, and
  other reusable layout primitives.
- `mdi_svg` and `weather_svg` Jinja2 filters for inlining MDI and weather
  icons directly into SVG templates.
- State circle indicator on `status_icons` widget, controlled by the new
  `show_icon` and `show_state` options.
- Card container (`card_style`) support for the `text` widget.
- Standalone design tool (`tools/design_widget.py`) for iterating on widget
  layouts outside of Home Assistant.
- CI job publishing JUnit test results to GitHub Actions.

### Changed

- Editor canvas preview replaced by server-rendered SVGs; drag and resize
  interactions rewritten accordingly.
- `status_icons` widget redesigned from pill chips to icon-and-text labels.
- Config flow screen-portion selection step restricted to TRMNL devices only.
- TRMNL documentation URL standardised to `trmnl.com`.
- Build tooling migrated from tox to `uv`.

### Removed

- `LINE` widget type.
- PIL drawing infrastructure (`render.py` PIL helpers).
- cairosvg icon build pipeline.

### Fixed

- Widget SVG viewport clipped to the widget's content dimensions, preventing
  overflow into adjacent widgets.
- Card border inset now included in the `device_battery` natural-width
  calculation.
- Weather forecasts are now fetched in the SVG preview WebSocket handlers so
  the editor shows live forecast data.
- Config flow orientation indicator shown in the screen-portion step title.
