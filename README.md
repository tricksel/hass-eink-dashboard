# E-Ink Dashboard for Home Assistant

Home Assistant custom component that renders e-ink dashboard images as PNG
directly from entity state using Pillow, and serves them to Kindle and TRMNL
devices. No Chromium, no ImageMagick, no Node.js.

## Features

- **Multiple e-ink displays** - create a separate dashboard for each device
  with its own layout, resolution, and refresh interval
- **Device presets** - built-in profiles for Kindle 4/5, Paperwhite 1-4,
  Oasis 2/3, TRMNL OG/X/RGB, or enter a custom resolution
- **Portrait and landscape** - rotation is handled automatically based on the
  device preset and chosen orientation
- **WYSIWYG Lovelace editor** - drag, resize, and configure widgets on a
  canvas preview that matches your device's exact pixel dimensions
- **Pull and push delivery** - devices can fetch the image on their own
  schedule (Kindle) or have HA push it via webhook (TRMNL)
- **E-ink optimization** - optional post-processing pipeline: autocontrast,
  sharpness, contrast adjustment, and grayscale quantization (2/4/16/256
  levels with Floyd-Steinberg dithering)
- **Jinja2 templates** - text widgets support Home Assistant templates
  (e.g. `{{ now().strftime('%H:%M') }}`)
- **ETag support** - conditional HTTP responses so devices skip the download
  and e-ink refresh when the image has not changed
- **Webhook rate limiting** - push targets are throttled to one push per 5
  minutes with a 5 MB size cap

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

1. Open HACS in your Home Assistant instance.
2. Click the three-dot menu → **Custom repositories**.
3. Add `https://github.com/cryptomilk/hass-eink-dashboard` with
   category **Integration**.
4. Search for "E-Ink Dashboard" and click **Download**.
5. Restart Home Assistant.

Once the repository is included in the HACS default store, steps 2–3 can
be skipped.

### Manual

1. Download `eink_dashboard.zip` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/cryptomilk/hass-eink-dashboard/releases/latest).
2. Extract into `custom_components/eink_dashboard/`:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p /path/to/homeassistant/custom_components/eink_dashboard
   unzip eink_dashboard.zip -d /path/to/homeassistant/custom_components/eink_dashboard/
   ```

3. Restart Home Assistant.

## Setup

Go to **Settings -> Devices & Services -> Add Integration** and search for
**E-Ink Dashboard**.

### Step 1 -- Device

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Name | Label for this dashboard (e.g. "Kitchen Kindle") |
| Device model | Select your e-ink display from the preset list, or choose **Custom** to enter a resolution manually |
| Orientation | Portrait or landscape layout |
| Area | Optional - assign the device to a Home Assistant area |
| Update interval | How often to re-render, in seconds (default: 60) |

Supported device presets:

| Preset | Resolution | Grayscale levels |
|---|---|---|
| Kindle 4/5 | 600 × 800 | 16 |
| Kindle Paperwhite 1/2/3 | 758 × 1024 | 16 |
| Kindle Paperwhite 4 | 1072 × 1448 | 16 |
| Kindle Oasis 2/3 | 1264 × 1680 | 16 |
| TRMNL OG | 800 × 480 | 2 (black & white) |
| TRMNL X | 1872 × 1404 | 16 |
| TRMNL RGB | 2560 × 1440 | 2 (black & white) |
| Custom | user-defined | 16 |

### Step 2 -- Image delivery

For **Custom** devices, you get a choice:

- **Pull only** - the device fetches the image from HA on its own schedule.
  Choose this for Kindle.
- **TRMNL webhook** - HA pushes the rendered PNG to TRMNL after each render.
  See [TRMNL setup](#trmnl) below.

For **Kindle** presets, the integration is configured in pull mode
automatically. For **TRMNL** presets, you are guided through the webhook
setup.

### Reconfigure

After setup, click **Configure** on the integration entry to:

- **Device settings** - change device model, orientation, or area
- **Display settings** - update interval, e-ink optimization toggle,
  grayscale levels, sharpness, contrast
- **Add / remove push target** - manage TRMNL webhook URLs
- **Copy card YAML** - get the Lovelace card snippet for this device
- **Copy dashboard YAML** - get a full dashboard YAML with cards for all
  configured devices

## Dashboard setup

The component ships a WYSIWYG Lovelace card for editing the dashboard layout.

### Quick start

1. Go to **Settings -> Dashboards -> Add Dashboard**. Give it a name
   (e.g. "Kitchen Kindle") and save.

2. Open the new dashboard, click the three-dot menu -> **Edit dashboard** ->
   **Raw configuration editor**.

3. Paste the YAML. You can get it from the integration's **Configure** menu
   (**Copy card YAML** or **Copy dashboard YAML**), or write it manually:

   ```yaml
   views:
     - title: E-Ink Dashboard
       cards:
         - type: custom:eink-dashboard-card
           config_entry: <entry_id>
   ```

   The `config_entry` field selects which display to edit. Find the entry ID
   in the integration URL or use the **Copy card YAML** option. If you only
   have one E-Ink Dashboard entry, you can omit `config_entry` and the card
   will auto-discover it.

4. Save. The card shows a live canvas preview at the exact pixel dimensions
   of your device.

### Editing widgets

1. Click **Edit Widgets** to open the editor panel.
2. Add widgets from the dropdown, reorder them with the up/down buttons, and
   configure each widget's properties in the form.
3. Click **Save** to persist the layout. The image entity is refreshed
   immediately.
4. Click **Show rendered image** to fetch the actual Pillow-rendered PNG for
   a pixel-exact comparison with the canvas preview.

### Available widgets (Work in progress)

| Type | What it renders |
|---|---|
| Text | Static or Jinja2 template text (e.g. `{{ now().strftime('%H:%M') }}`) |
| Line | Horizontal or diagonal line |
| Separator | Full-width horizontal rule |
| Weather | Current conditions + N-day forecast with icons |
| Sensor Rows | Label / value rows for a list of sensors |
| Battery Bar | Horizontal battery level bar with percentage |
| Status Icons | Row of filled/outline squares for binary sensors |
| Waste Schedule | Upcoming waste collection dates (today, tomorrow, in N days) |

All widgets support `x`, `y` positioning and `font_size`. Most support a `w`
(width) override to constrain rendering to a sub-region of the display.

## Device setup

### Kindle

Use [kndl-online-screensaver](https://codeberg.org/cryptomilk/kndl-online-screensaver/)
on your Kindle. It supports ETag-based conditional fetching (skips the
download and e-ink refresh when the image has not changed) and battery
reporting.

Point it at the public image endpoint:

```
http://<ha-ip>:8123/api/eink_dashboard/<entry_id>/image.png
```

This endpoint requires no authentication.

#### Kindle and HTTPS (nginx)

Older Kindles cannot connect to modern HTTPS servers. If Home Assistant is
behind an HTTPS reverse proxy, add an HTTP-only location for the image
endpoint:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name homeassistant.example.com;

    # E-Ink dashboard image - plain HTTP for Kindle
    location ~ ^/api/eink_dashboard/[^/]+/image\.png$ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8123;
    }

    # Everything else → HTTPS
    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}
```

This exposes only the unauthenticated image endpoint over HTTP. The
authenticated layout API remains HTTPS-only.

### TRMNL

1. Go to [usetrmnl.com](https://usetrmnl.com) -> **Plugins** -> **Webhook Image**.
2. Give the plugin a name, set **Image Fit Mode** to **Contain**, and click
   **Save**.
3. Copy the **Webhook URL** (looks like
   `https://trmnl.com/api/custom_plugins/<uuid>`).
4. During the HA config flow, choose **TRMNL webhook** and paste the URL.

HA pushes the rendered PNG to TRMNL whenever the image changes, subject to a
minimum interval of 5 minutes and a 5 MB size cap per push.

You can add multiple TRMNL webhook targets per dashboard entry via
**Configure -> Add push target**.
